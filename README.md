# Short scripts
 A collection of scripts that do simple things that need doing.

 The repository is divided in to a number of folders which contain scripts written for Python, R, BASH or the SGE qsub scripting environments. Larger scripts that do very specific tasks may be placed in a subfolder.

 I'm no expert on any of these languages or English for that matter, but the scripts work and do what I want, but may not do it in the best way possible and some may object to certain features, but they work for me. However, they may need a little tweak to work on your machine.
